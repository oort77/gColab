# gColab
 Makes script for import of dataset archive to colab.   

If you have a dataset for a shared colab notebook, please consider using this utility script.

1. It uploads the most recently created zip archive to a specified Google Drive folder.
2. Then it creates a snippet for insertion into your colab notebook. Just paste it from the clipboard.

That's it.
